This document collects information on MQTT messages published by the Fluksometer v03E ([FLM03E](https://www.flukso.net/content/overdue-status-update)); refer to [flukso.net](http://flukso.net) for further information on the idea behind _Flukso_.

Note: MQTT topics of FLM02 and FLM03 are different and with respect to configuration incompatible; thus, currently existing subscription functionality using the FLM02 variant is NOT working out-of-the-box with an FLM03E; corresponding to my investigations I adapt to a FLM03 version; these are stored in a respective branch of referring repositories (most likely I will sync master and FLM03 branches as FLM03 is the way forward).

# Device topics
Device topics of the Fluksometer start with ```/device/<device_id>/```.

## Configuration
The configuration topics ```/device/+/config/+``` provide three distinct sub-topics, ```flx```, ```kube```, and ```sensor``` showing the current FLM configuration. As payload a JSON object is sent that in the following is described in more detail.

### flx
The ```flx``` topic provides as payload the basic configuration of sensors attached to the Fluksometer. Eight properties give insight in the sensor configuration as set in the sensor configuration page, plus a ```main``` property. The sensor properties are an enumeration of the ports 1 to 7 with value an object describing the respective sensor parameters:

	"ENUM": {
		enable: 1|0,
		class: "ct"|"pulse"|"uart",
		name: "<sensor name>",
		shift: 0,
		current: 50|100|500,
		constant: <pulse constant>,
		uart_tx_invert: 0|1,
		dsmr: 4,
		uart_rx_invert: 0|1
	}

Note that value properties vary with the sensor class, for example the uart and dsmr is sent for the uart port only.

The "last" property is the ```main``` property, defining the LED mode and current clamp setup for single phase or three phase measurement (with and without neutral).

	main: {
		led_mode: 255,
		phase: "1p"|"3p+n"|"3p-n",
		theta: 130
	}

### kube
The ```kube``` topic contains information on the paired FluksoKubes. By default, without paired Kube, it contains only a ```main``` property:

	{
		"1": {
			"enable": 1,
			"name": "<kube name given in the config page>",
			"hw_type": 19218,
			"hw_id": "<hw guid>",
			"sw_version": 1
	},
		"main": {
			"encryption": 0,
			"max_nodes": 30,
			"pair_group": 212,
			"null_key": "0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef",
			"cache": "/usr/share/kube",
			"collect_group": 174,
			"key": "<key guid>"
		}
	}

### sensor
The ```sensor``` topic publishes the actual sensor configuration which enumerates to up to 128 different types of information plus configuration of ```tmpo```, ```mqtt```, and ```daemon```. With just three current clamps attached, there are already 39 different types of values available. Non-assigned sensor data provides the sensor ```Ã¬d``` only.

	"ENUM": {
    	"type": "electricity",
    	"subtype": "pplus"|"pminus"|"q1"|"q2"|"q3"|"q4"|"vrms"|"irms"|"pf"|"vthd"|"ithd"|"alpha",
    	"id": "<sensor_id>",
    	"enable": 1,
    	"rid": 0,
    	"port": [
        	<port_number>
    	],
    	"data_type": "counter"|"gauge"
	},

	tmpo: {
		root: "/flukso/"
	},

	mqtt: {
		"bridge_restart_timeout": 30,
    	"bridge_address": "api.flukso.net",
    	"bridge_port": 8883,
    	"bridge_keepalive": 60
	},

	daemon": {
    	"cacert": "/etc/ssl/certs/flukso.ca.crt",
    	"upgrade_url": "http://www.flukso.net/files/upgrade/",
    	"wan_base_url": "https://api.flukso.net/"
	}

Note: There are 12 settings per current clamp, and "only" one setting (as counter) for each pulse port; 39 thus is the total number of "default" sensors without cubes; those disabled still show up, but with property ```enable: 0```.  

Note: Starting with "40" FluskoKubes have an own section corresponding to class _kube_. Here a kube id _kid_ distinguishes the different kubes paired with a Fluksometer. They are different to the previous sensor ENUMs as they do not have a subtype, but provide their measurement description via the type property directly linked to the _kid_'s configuration.

  	"40": {
			"id": "<kube id>",
			"class": "kube",
			"kid": 1,
			"enable": 1,
			"rid": 0,
			"data_type": "counter",
			"type": "proximity|humidity|battery|pressure|movement|vibration|temperature|error|light"
		},

## Device sensor sampling

### flx
The "sensor sampling" topics ```/device/<device_id>/flx/+/+``` publish information on current and voltage sampled from the current clamps as a JSON array

	/device/<device_id>/flx/voltage/<sensor_ENUM> [[<timestamp>,500],[<comma separated list of 32 sampling values>],"mV"]
	/device/<device_id>/flx/current/<sensor_ENUM> [[<timestamp>,500],[<comma separated list of 32 sampling values>],"mA"]

This needs some further investigation, especially as it provides quite high traffic.

### flx/time
There is a ```/device/<device_id>/flx/time``` topic which seems to publish information on the reference between the base device's and the sensor board's time setup used for sampling.

	 {
	 	flm: {
	 		time:[<timestamp>,12369],
	 		update:false
	 	},
	 	flx:{
	 		time:[<timestamp>,0],
	 		update:false
	 	}
	 }

# Sensor topics
As with the Fluksometer version 2, there are also sensor gauge and counter topics provided by the FLM03.

## Gauges
The topics ```/sensor/<sensor_id>/gauge``` publish gauge values of the respective sensor in the "known" way, as a JSON array with timestamp, value, and unit; new are units "VAR", "V", and "A".

	/sensor/<sensor_id>/gauge [<timestamp>, <decimal value with three digits>, "<unit>"]

## Counters
In analogy to the gauges, the counter topic ```/sensor/<sensor_id>/counter``` delivers counter values of the respective sensor collected as "Wh" and "VARh".

	/sensor/<sensor_id>/counter [<timestamp>, <decimal value with three digits>, "unit"]

## TMPO
For synchronizing readings with the Flukso website, the FLM publishes a ```tmpo``` topic, transferring readings as a gzipped payload

	/sensor/<sensor_id>/tmpo/<rid>/<level/<block_id>/gz <gzipped tmpo object>

Refer to the [TMPO retrieval info](https://github.com/gebhardm/energyhacks/tree/master/Flukso/tmpo) for further details.
